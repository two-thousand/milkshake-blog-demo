Product Requirements Document: Minimalist Blog Prototype

1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a prototype blog intended to showcase a clean, minimalist aesthetic inspired by websites like The Cut (www.thecut.com). The goal of this prototype is to demonstrate a potential design direction to the user's friend and streamline the feedback process.

2. Goals

To create a visually appealing and user-friendly blog prototype.
To showcase a typography-forward design with clear visual hierarchy.
To demonstrate a minimalist color palette with strategic accent colors.
To illustrate the use of generous white space for enhanced readability.
To provide a basic structure for showcasing different content categories.
To centralize the discussion and gather specific feedback from the friend. 3. Target Audience

The primary audience for this prototype is the user's friend. The secondary audience is the user themselves, for development and demonstration purposes.

4. Product Scope

This prototype will focus on the core visual elements and basic structure of a blog. It will not include advanced features like user accounts, commenting systems, or complex content management.

5. Design Requirements (Based on The Cut Aesthetic)

Typography:
Utilize elegant serif fonts for headlines and article titles.
Employ a contrasting, readable sans-serif font for body text.
Establish clear font sizes and weights to create a visual hierarchy.
Color Palette:
Primarily black and white for the base.
Incorporate a single accent color (e.g., red) for interactive elements, timestamps, and potentially category indicators.
Layout and Spacing:
Implement a grid-based structure for content organization.
Ensure generous white space around all elements to improve readability and create a sense of spaciousness.
Allow for featured stories to occupy larger sections of the grid.
Content Structure:
Include a basic navigation menu with placeholder links for content categories (e.g., STYLE, SELF, CULTURE, POWER).
Design a homepage layout that showcases recent or featured blog posts.
Create a template for individual blog post pages.
Visual Elements:
Demonstrate the integration of photography within the layout.
Consider incorporating simple, clean illustrations as placeholders for potential concept-driven content. 6. Functional Requirements (Basic)

Allow users to click on a blog post title to view the full content.
Display the blog post title, author (placeholder), and a date (placeholder) on the individual post page.
Include placeholder text for the body content of blog posts.
The navigation menu should be static or clearly visible. 7. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: The prototype should load quickly.
Responsiveness: While not a primary focus for this initial prototype, consider a layout that could adapt to different screen sizes in the future.
Maintainability: The codebase should be clean and easy to understand for future iterations. 8. Success Metrics

The friend understands the proposed design direction.
The friend provides specific feedback on the visual elements and structure.
The prototype effectively communicates the desired minimalist aesthetic. 9. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Prototype)

Full content management system (CMS) integration.
User authentication and commenting system.
Advanced search functionality.
Responsive design across various devices.
SEO optimization.
